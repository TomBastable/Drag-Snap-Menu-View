# Drag / Snap Menu View

A simple draggable / snapping menu class for UIView that allows for peeking and handles non-directional gestures.

Easy to modify the behaviour - currently if a touch is idle and the menu is above the center point, the menu will open when the touches release. If a touch is idle and released below the center then it will close. If a touch is made in a specific direction then it will spring open in that direction. Easy to modify this so that it snaps above certain points however stays open below others.
